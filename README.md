Real-Time Multi-Client Chat Application
Chat Application with Direct Messaging Feature
This is a simple, multi-client chat application built using Pythonâ€™s socket and threading libraries. The application supports real-time communication between multiple clients connected to a central server. The server handles client connections, broadcasts messages to all clients, and also supports direct messaging between users.

Features:
Multi-client Chat: Multiple clients can join the chat room and exchange messages.
Direct Messaging: Users can send private messages to specific users using the /dm <username> <message> command.
Server Management: The server broadcasts user activity (joins, leaves) and messages to all clients.
Real-time Communication: Messages are sent and received in real-time.
Client Interface: Users can input messages in the command line interface.
